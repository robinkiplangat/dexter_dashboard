# Dexter API Documentation

This directory will contain comprehensive documentation for the Dexter platform's APIs when they are implemented. This documentation will serve as a reference for developers working with the Dexter API.

## API Structure

The Dexter API will be organized around the following main endpoints:

```
/api/v1/auth - Authentication and user management
/api/v1/narratives - Narrative detection and management
/api/v1/content - Content ingestion and analysis
/api/v1/actors - Actor identification and network analysis
/api/v1/alerts - Alert generation and management
/api/v1/reports - Report creation and export
/api/v1/dashboard - Dashboard data aggregation
/api/v1/lexicon - Lexicon management and updates
```

## Documentation Plan

As the API implementation progresses, the following documentation will be developed:

1. **API Overview** - Introduction to the Dexter API and general concepts
2. **Authentication Documentation** - Details on authentication methods and tokens
3. **Endpoint Reference** - Comprehensive documentation for each endpoint
4. **Error Handling Guidelines** - Standard error codes and handling approaches
5. **Rate Limiting Information** - API usage limits and best practices
6. **Example Integrations** - Sample code for common integration scenarios
7. **Changelog** - Documentation of API changes and versioning

## Format and Standards

API documentation will follow these standards:

- OpenAPI (Swagger) specification for technical documentation
- Clear examples for each endpoint
- Request and response schema definitions
- Status codes and error handling information
- Authentication requirements
- Rate limiting details

## Planned Implementation Timeline

API documentation will be developed alongside the API implementation according to this schedule:

1. **Initial API Specification** - During Foundation Phase
2. **Core Endpoints Documentation** - During Core Functionality Phase
3. **Complete API Reference** - End of Core Functionality Phase
4. **Advanced Features Documentation** - During Advanced Features Phase

## Using This Documentation

Once implemented, developers will be able to:

1. Browse the full API reference
2. Test endpoints using interactive documentation
3. View example requests and responses
4. Understand authentication and authorization requirements
5. Access code samples for common languages

This documentation will serve as both a reference guide and a learning resource for developers integrating with the Dexter platform.
