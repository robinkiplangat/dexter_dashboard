## Product Overview
In today’s digital landscape, misinformation spreads rapidly, posing a significant threat to democratic processes, especially during elections. **Dexter** is an AI-powered platform designed to tackle this challenge, starting with Nigeria. By detecting, tracking, and analyzing election-related misinformation and coordinated inauthentic behavior (CIB), Dexter equips civil society, journalists, fact-checkers, and election observers with real-time tools to respond effectively and safeguard election integrity.

## Target Audience
Dexter serves:
- **Civil society organizations** monitoring election integrity
- **Journalists and fact-checkers** investigating misinformation
- **Election observers** requiring timely insights
- **Researchers** analyzing electoral information dynamics

## Key Features
- **Narrative Tracking**: Detects misinformation themes (e.g., vote rigging, ethnic profiling, voter intimidation) using advanced natural language processing (NLP), adapting to local languages, slang, and evolving discourse.
- **Actor Identification**: Maps key spreaders and networks behind misinformation through graph analysis and clustering, identifying coordinated campaigns and influential actors.

The platform offers role-specific, customizable dashboards with intuitive visualizations of trends, narratives, and actor networks. Users can explore data interactively and contribute feedback via tagging and validation tools, enhancing system accuracy over time.

## Implementation and Deployment
Development is phased:
1. Lexicon and narrative corpus creation
2. Data ingestion and storage setup
3. AI model prototyping and evaluation
4. User interface design and integration
5. End-user testing and refinement

The Minimum Viable Product (MVP) is slated for completion in 6-8 months, with iterative updates driven by Nigerian stakeholder feedback.

## Partnerships and Collaborations
Dexter is built in partnership with Nigerian civil society, media organizations, and academic institutions, ensuring it reflects local expertise and meets community needs.
