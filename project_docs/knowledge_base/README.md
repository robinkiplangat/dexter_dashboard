# Dexter Knowledge Base

This knowledge base serves as a central repository for information about the Dexter project - an election misinformation detection and tracking platform designed for Nigeria.

## Purpose

The knowledge base aims to:
1. Provide a comprehensive understanding of the project
2. Document the current state of implementation
3. Track progress as the project evolves
4. Serve as a reference for new team members
5. Document technical decisions and architecture

## Structure

The knowledge base is organized as follows:

1. **[Project Overview](./project_overview.md)** - High-level description of the project, its goals, and target users
2. **[Technical Architecture](./technical_architecture.md)** - System design, data models, and technical specifications
3. **[Implementation Status](./implementation_status.md)** - Current state of the project and progress tracking
4. **[Implementation Roadmap](./implementation_roadmap.md)** - Detailed plan for completing the project
5. **[User Guides](./user_guides/)** - Documentation for different user types (researchers, journalists, observers)
6. **[API Documentation](./api_docs/)** - Documentation for backend APIs when implemented
7. **[Contribution Guidelines](./contribution_guidelines.md)** - How to contribute to the project

## Maintenance

This knowledge base should be updated regularly as the project evolves. All significant changes to the project should be reflected here to ensure it remains a reliable source of information.
