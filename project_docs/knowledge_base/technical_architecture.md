## Core Data Models

Dexter's data architecture is built around the following key entities:

### User
- Represents platform users with different roles (admin, researcher, observer, analyst, viewer)
- Stores authentication and profile information
- Tracks activity and preferences

### Narrative
- Represents a specific misinformation theme or story
- Contains identifying information (keywords, hashtags)
- Categorized by type (vote rigging, ethnic profiling, etc.)
- Tracks evolution over time

### Content
- Represents individual pieces of content (posts, articles, videos)
- Links to source platforms
- Contains analysis results (sentiment, entities, classification)
- May be linked to multiple narratives

### Actor
- Represents content creators (accounts, organizations)
- Tracks influence metrics and behavioral patterns
- Identifies coordinated networks

### Alert
- Represents notifications about significant events
- Varies by type (volume spike, new narrative, coordinated activity)
- Includes severity levels and assignees

### Report
- Represents analysis outputs for sharing
- Contains snapshots of data and visualizations
- Can be customized and exported

### Lexicon
- Represents collections of terms for specific regions/languages
- Used for improving detection accuracy in local contexts

## API Structure

The Dexter API is organized around the following main endpoints:

```
/api/v1/auth - Authentication and user management
/api/v1/narratives - Narrative detection and management
/api/v1/content - Content ingestion and analysis
/api/v1/actors - Actor identification and network analysis
/api/v1/alerts - Alert generation and management
/api/v1/reports - Report creation and export
/api/v1/dashboard - Dashboard data aggregation
/api/v1/lexicon - Lexicon management and updates
```

## Security Architecture

Dexter implements a robust security model:

1. **Authentication** - JWT-based authentication with refresh tokens
2. **Authorization** - Role-based access control (RBAC)
3. **Data Protection** - Encryption for sensitive data at rest and in transit
4. **API Security** - Rate limiting, CORS, and input validation
5. **Audit Logging** - Comprehensive activity tracking for security monitoring

## Scalability Considerations

The Dexter architecture is designed to scale in several dimensions:

1. **Horizontal Scaling** - Containerized services can scale independently
2. **Data Partitioning** - Sharding strategies for large datasets
3. **Caching Layers** - Multi-level caching for improved performance
4. **Asynchronous Processing** - Message queues for handling peak loads
5. **CDN Integration** - For global content delivery when needed

## Ethical AI Framework

The technical implementation includes specific components for ethical AI:

1. **Transparency Logging** - Records model decisions and confidence levels
2. **Bias Detection** - Monitors for biases in training data and outputs
3. **Human Review Interface** - Allows expert review of uncertain classifications
4. **Explainable Outputs** - Provides reasoning behind automated decisions
