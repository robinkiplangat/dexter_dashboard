   - Actor and network analysis
   - Timeline and trend analysis
   - Alerts and reporting systems

3. **Advanced Features & Scale Phase (3 Months)**
   - Multilingual support
   - Media analysis capabilities
   - Collaborative features
   - Performance optimization

4. **Ethical AI & Platform Expansion Phase (2 Months)**
   - Ethical AI framework implementation
   - API and integration development
   - Predictive analytics
   - Geographic expansion framework

See the full [Implementation Roadmap](./implementation_roadmap.md) for detailed sprint plans, milestones, and deliverables.

## Current Implementation Status

As of May 14, 2025, Dexter is in the early development phase:

- Frontend foundations established with React, Vite, and TailwindCSS
- Basic UI components created with mock data
- System architecture and data models designed
- Documentation in place (PRD, system design, diagrams)

Next steps focus on backend implementation, database setup, and integration of real data with the frontend.

See the [Implementation Status](./implementation_status.md) document for a detailed breakdown of the current state of implementation.

## How to Use This Knowledge Base

This knowledge base is designed to be a living document that evolves as the project progresses. Contributors should:

1. Reference these documents when working on the project
2. Update relevant documents when making significant changes
3. Create new documents for new features or architectural decisions
4. Keep the implementation status and roadmap up to date

This collaborative approach ensures that the knowledge base remains a valuable resource for all team members throughout the development lifecycle.
