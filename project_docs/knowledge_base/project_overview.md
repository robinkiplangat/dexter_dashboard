# Dexter Project Overview

## Introduction

Dexter is an end-to-end platform designed for researchers and election observers to detect and track election misinformation, especially in the Nigerian context. Built as a web-based application fully optimized for mobile screens, it provides a responsive dashboard with real-time insights into election-related misinformation.

## Product Vision

Dexter aims to be the leading platform for detecting, analyzing, and responding to election misinformation in Nigeria, with future potential to expand to other regions.

## Product Goals

1. **Comprehensive Detection:** Create a scalable AI-driven system that effectively detects, tracks, and analyzes election-related misinformation and coordinated inauthentic behavior across multiple platforms, languages, and media types.

2. **Actionable Intelligence:** Provide civil society organizations, journalists, fact-checkers, and election observers with real-time, actionable insights that enable timely intervention against election misinformation.

3. **Ethical Transparency:** Establish a trustworthy system that adheres to ethical AI principles, incorporates diverse perspectives, and maintains transparent operations while safeguarding democratic processes.

## Target Users

Dexter serves multiple user types, each with specific needs:

1. **Civil Society Organizations:** Need to track emerging misinformation narratives across social media platforms to develop targeted counter-messaging campaigns before false information becomes widespread.

2. **Journalists:** Need to identify key spreaders and coordinated networks to report accurately on who is behind manipulation campaigns.

3. **Election Observers:** Need real-time alerts about local misinformation trends to adjust monitoring efforts and verify on-the-ground conditions.

4. **Research Analysts:** Need to visualize how misinformation narratives evolve over time and across platforms to identify critical intervention points and patterns of manipulation.

5. **Fact-Checking Organizations:** Need access to Nigeria-specific lexicons and cultural context to accurately identify coded messaging and localized misinformation narratives.
