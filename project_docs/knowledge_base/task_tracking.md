# Dexter Task Tracking

This document serves as a practical task tracking tool for the Dexter project, focusing on immediate and short-term tasks. It complements the implementation roadmap by providing a more granular view of work items.

## Current Sprint Tasks

### Sprint 1: Project Setup & Architecture (Current)

| Task | Assignee | Status | Priority | Due Date | Notes |
|------|----------|--------|----------|----------|-------|
| âœ… Create project repository | - | Completed | High | - | Initial repository setup completed |
| âœ… Set up frontend dev environment | - | Completed | High | - | React, Vite, TailwindCSS configured |
| âœ… Design system architecture | - | Completed | High | - | Architecture documented in system design doc |
| âœ… Create initial UI components | - | Completed | High | - | Basic components created with mock data |
| âœ… Create knowledge base structure | - | Completed | Medium | - | Knowledge base structure established |
| ðŸ”„ Set up backend development environment | - | Not Started | High | - | Node.js/Express and FastAPI setup needed |
| ðŸ”„ Configure Docker containers | - | Not Started | Medium | - | Development containers needed |

## Upcoming Tasks

### Sprint 2: Core Backend Infrastructure

| Task | Assignee | Status | Priority | Due Date | Notes |
|------|----------|--------|----------|----------|-------|
| ðŸ”„ Implement database schemas | - | Not Started | High | - | PostgreSQL schemas needed |
| ðŸ”„ Implement authentication service | - | Not Started | High | - | JWT-based auth system |
| ðŸ”„ Create API gateway | - | Not Started | High | - | Basic routing setup |
| ðŸ”„ Set up environments | - | Not Started | Medium | - | Dev and staging needed |
| ðŸ”„ Implement CI/CD pipelines | - | Not Started | Medium | - | GitHub Actions for automation |

### Sprint 3: Data Collection Framework

| Task | Assignee | Status | Priority | Due Date | Notes |
|------|----------|--------|----------|----------|-------|
| ðŸ”„ Implement social media API connectors | - | Not Started | High | - | Start with Twitter/X and Facebook |
| ðŸ”„ Create data collection service | - | Not Started | High | - | With rate limiting and caching |
| ðŸ”„ Implement unified data schema | - | Not Started | High | - | For cross-platform analysis |
| ðŸ”„ Develop data storage and retrieval | - | Not Started | Medium | - | Database operations |
| ðŸ”„ Create basic data explorer interface | - | Not Started | Medium | - | Simple UI for viewing collected data |

## Blocked Tasks

| Task | Blocker | Priority | Notes |
|------|---------|----------|-------|
| Implement social media API integrations | Need API access credentials | High | Requires registration with platform dev programs |
| Deploy to staging environment | DevOps infrastructure not set up | Medium | Need to set up cloud infrastructure |

## Technical Debt

| Description | Impact | Priority | Notes |
|-------------|--------|----------|-------|
| Mock data in UI components | Limited testing capability | Medium | Replace with real data when backend is ready |
| Placeholder visualizations | Cannot demonstrate full capabilities | Medium | Implement actual charts and graphs |
| Limited error handling | Poor user experience on failures | High | Implement comprehensive error handling |

## Key Decisions Needed

1. **Social Media API Strategy**
   - Which platforms to prioritize?
   - How to handle API rate limiting?
   - Alternative data collection approaches for platforms with limited API access?

2. **Database Implementation**
   - Finalize schema design
   - Decide on indexing strategy for performance
   - Determine partitioning approach for scaling

3. **Authentication & Authorization**
   - Select specific authentication provider/approach
   - Define detailed role permissions
   - Determine session management strategy

## Task Priorities Legend

- **Critical**: Blocking project progress; must be addressed immediately
- **High**: Essential for core functionality; should be prioritized
- **Medium**: Important but not blocking; should be addressed in current or next sprint
- **Low**: Nice to have; can be deferred if necessary

## How to Use This Document

1. Update task status regularly during stand-up meetings
2. Use this as a reference for sprint planning
3. Prioritize tasks based on dependencies and critical path
4. Document blockers as they arise and note when resolved

This task tracking document should be updated at least weekly to reflect current progress and priorities.
